\format{
A data frame with 24 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
\item{Sample}{Sample identifier: Control, Treatment_A, Treatment_B, or Treatment_C}
\item{Target}{Target gene or reference gene name: Target_Gene or Reference_Gene}
\item{Cq}{Ct value from qPCR, with expected values:
\itemize{
\item Reference_Gene: ~20 (stable across conditions)
\item Target_Gene:
\itemize{
\item Control: ~25
\item Treatment_A: ~24 (2-fold increase)
\item Treatment_B: ~23 (4-fold increase)
\item Treatment_C: ~26 (0.5-fold decrease)

\item{Omit}{Logical indicating whether to omit the sample (includes one outlier for demonstration)}
\item{Replicate}{Technical replicate number (1-3)}

\description{
A dataset containing example qPCR results for demonstrating the analyze_pcr function.
The data includes Ct values for a target gene and a reference gene across multiple samples,
with known fold changes relative to the control group.
}
\details{
The dataset is designed to demonstrate both delta-delta CT and direct CT analysis methods:
\itemize{
\item Control: baseline expression
\item Treatment_A: 2-fold increase (-1 Ct)
\item Treatment_B: 4-fold increase (-2 Ct)
\item Treatment_C: 0.5-fold decrease (+1 Ct)
}

The reference gene is designed to be stable across all conditions with a base Ct of 20.
The target gene has a base Ct of 25 in the control condition.
Technical variation is simulated with a standard deviation of 0.3 Ct.
