\title{Detect Outliers in RNA-seq Data with Optional Group-wise Comparisons}
\usage{
detect_outliers(dds, group_col = NULL, n_mad = 3, cook_threshold = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{dds}{A DESeqDataSet object containing RNA-seq data}

\item{group_col}{Optional character specifying the column name in colData(dds) for group information.
This should match one of the column names in colData(dds). For example, if your
experimental design includes a treatment column named "condition", you would set
group_col = "condition". If NULL (default), analysis is performed across all samples.}

\item{n_mad}{Numeric value specifying the number of MADs for the distance threshold (default: 3)}

\item{cook_threshold}{Numeric value for Cook's distance quantile threshold (default: 0.99)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item mad_outliers: Sample names identified as outliers based on MAD distances
\item cook_outliers: Sample names identified as outliers based on Cook's distances
\item correlation_outliers: Sample names identified as outliers based on correlation
\item all_outliers: Combined unique list of all identified outliers
\item metrics: List of computed metrics used for outlier detection
}
}
\description{
This function identifies potential outlier samples in RNA-seq data using multiple methods.
It can perform analysis either across all samples or within experimental groups.
}
\examples{
# Without groups (analyze all samples together)
outliers <- detect_outliers(dds)

# With groups (analyze within treatment groups)
outliers <- detect_outliers(dds, group_col = "condition")
